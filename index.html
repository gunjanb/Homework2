        <h3>What is Responsive Web Design (RWD)</h3>
        <p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS and media queries.

        <h3>What Issues RWD can solve?</h3>
        <p> People using smartphones and other mobile devices are increasing more day by day, so it’s crucial for every organization to use Responsive Web Design (RWD) for their websites because it allows their sites to be automatically displayed on any system, no matter what the screen size is. In this fast-evolving era, more than 20% of Google searches are being performed on a mobile device, and 25% of American Internet users go on the Internet mainly from their mobile devices. So, it is important to build responsive websites in order to ensure that these users have a positive experience when they browse the web from all types of devices. After all, there’s a 61% chance Internet users will leave your site if it isn’t appealing or structured well, and this can happen if they’re on your mobile site and the screen size and viewing orientation are irritating them.
        </p>
        <p>Most of the time, mobile site-related issues can be resolved with the creation of a responsive website. Below are few issues that RWD can solve:
        </p>
        <p>1.Sharing content: Without a responsive website, you would have two separate URLs, one for the regular site and the other for the mobile site. However, this causes many issues when Internet users attempt to share your content. Just imagine the chaos of opening a mobile URL on a computer, only for the page to look ill proportioned. Having a responsive website allows users to share and link to your content with a single URL, so this problem would never happen again.
        </p>
        <p>2.Engineering time and manageability: When you finish updating your regular site, you’ll have to switch over to your mobile site and update it as well. All information you put up, including blogs and videos, must be worked on twice. With a responsive web design, you will have less engineering time since you would be maintaining only one site’s pages.
        </p>
        <p>3.Reduces common mistakes: Having two URLs, one for the regular site and the other for the mobile optimized site, can cause many common mistakes, like broken URL redirects. With a responsive website, you would reduce such mistakes that affect mobile sites.
        </p>
        <p>4.Load time: Without a responsive website, users would have to manually redirect themselves from your regular site to your mobile site. Having a responsive website, on the other hand, would automatically redirect a mobile user to the mobile version of your site, reducing load time and possible errors as well as making your site more user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>Taking above issues into account, it becomes clear that Responsive Web Design has many benefits to any professional website trying to draw in traffic. Between the ease of management, search engine optimization, and user accessibility, a responsive website is a worthwhile investment to make for a growing business in today’s world. Having a responsive website guarantees that no matter what device or screen size a user is viewing your website on, the page will display properly, and this will please your users, increase the likelihood that they will return to your site, and make sharing your content much easier between online platforms.
